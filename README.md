Word Editor, is a free and open-source text/document editor extension for your browser.

Word Editor is very similar to popular word processor apps available in the market, except, it works inside your browser without the need for any external plug-ins or software. You can open any text or HTML document with this add-on, and save the result in HTML format.

Please note that this add-on works with HTML document extension, in other words, all the input/output files need to be in the HTML format. Currently, it does not support other famous document formats such as .doc, .docx or etc. However, you can copy text from other software (such as MS word, webpage, etc.) and paste it in the add-on (preserving all the styles).

Since extensions, in general, do not have access to the hard drive in order to save files, this add-on uses the download API to gain file I/O access. Therefore, all the operations related to file storage are happening in the default download folder in your browser. If you want to change this folder, please head to the extensions tab in your browser, search for download settings and update the default folder to where you prefer.

Word Editor is built on top of the famous TinyMCE JavaScript library (https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce). Once you open the app for the first time, you will see a blank screen with a toolbar on top. Simply type or paste your document, and at the end, click on the save button (File > Save) to download the document as an HTML file in your system (default download location).
